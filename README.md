# Anomaly Detection in Astronomical Data Using Sampling Techniques

This study evaluates the effectiveness of sampling techniques for anomaly detection in astronomical datasets, specifically utilizing data from the **Gaia space telescope**. The focus is on **Random Forest classifiers**, comparing two sampling methods:

- **Random Sampling**
- **Uncertainty Sampling**

The impact of these methods on the class distribution of the sampled dataset and the classifierâ€™s accuracy in distinguishing normal and anomalous stellar objects is analyzed. The results demonstrate that **uncertainty sampling significantly outperforms random sampling**, leading to improved classification performance.

These findings underscore the importance of selecting the right sampling strategy when working with **imbalanced datasets**, providing insights for enhancing anomaly detection in astronomy.
